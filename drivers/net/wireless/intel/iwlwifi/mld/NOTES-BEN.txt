mvm patches that are not ported to mld, but probably should be:

Revert "iwlwifi: mvm: disable RX-diversity in powersave"
  #  Not sure on this one.

iwlwifi: Added block_traffic debugfs file ...
  # Will let Rory do this one.

wifi: iwlwifi: add esr into debugfs
  # Maybe not needed.

wifi: iwlwifi: use phy-ctx channel laod if no ies
  # Skipping, maybe not needed in mld driver
